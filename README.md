ATM Exercise

Welcome to the ATM Exercise! This project is a simple React application that simulates an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). It allows users to deposit money into their account or withdraw cash from it.

Description
In this project, I implemented a basic ATM interface with the following features:

* Deposit: Add funds to your account.
* Cash Back: Withdraw money from your account.
* Account Balance: View your current account balance.

Improvements Made
I made several improvements to enhance the usability and functionality of the ATM interface:

* Multi-Choice Selection: Replaced the separate "Deposit" and "Cash Back" buttons with a dropdown menu, providing a more intuitive way for users to select their transaction type.
* Input Validation: Implemented input validation to prevent users from making invalid transactions, such as withdrawing more money than is available in their account.

How to Use
*Upon loading the ATM interface, you'll see your current account balance displayed.
*Use the dropdown menu to select your desired transaction type: "Deposit" or "Cash Back."
*Enter the amount of money you want to deposit or withdraw in the input field.
*Click the "Submit" button to complete the transaction and see your updated account balance.

Improvements Made:

*Replaced separate buttons with a dropdown menu for transaction selection.
*Implemented input validation to prevent invalid transactions.

Approach:
I chose this approach to improve the user experience by simplifying the interface and adding validation to ensure data integrity.

Challenges Faced:
One challenge I encountered was centering the elements on the page and styling the dropdown menu appropriately. I overcame this by experimenting with CSS properties and adjusting the layout until it met my requirements.
